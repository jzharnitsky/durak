	***------ List of tasks for Josh -----***
FOR GAME GENERAL:
FOR AI
	- dont prompt if no legal moves
		- replace with helpful message
	- list legal moves
	- Cards in hand
	- Discard (aka history)

FOR dumbAI:
	FOR ATTACK():
		- if player takes after defending certain suit with kozer, remember suit until oponent takes
			- during attack, if have card of that suit (lower than J) use it instead of lowest card
		- during EndGame may be useful to attack with high kozers
	FOR ADDCARDS():
		- if opponent has lots of 'junk' on the table, add kozer (if kozer < J)
		- if endGame may be useful to add high Kozers

LONG TERM
	- make all print messages functions 
		- ex: printAtkMsg(attacker.name, defender.name)

GENETIC ALGORITHM
	1. (Start) Generate random population of n players
	2. (Fitness) Evaluate the fitness f(x) of each player in the population
	3. (New Population) Create a new population by repeating the following steps:
		a. (Selection) Select 2 parent players (better fitness->better chance to be selected)
		b. (Crossover) With a crossover probability cross over the parents to form a new offspring. 
			i. if no crossover offspring is an exact copy of parents
		c. (Mutation) With a mutation probability mutate new offspring at each parameter
		d. (Accepting) Place new offspring in a new population
	4. (Replace) Use new generated population for a further run of algorithm
	5. (Loop) go to step 2
